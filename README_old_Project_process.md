### 1. Abstract / Project objectives:
The main goal of this project is predicting Parkinson Disease (PD) Progression over time for a set of patients from a clinical study.

More precisely, the project objectives are:
Starting from a dataset of Electronic Health Records of patients with 4 different clinical diagnosis (PD diagnosed patients, 400 de novo PD subjects - newly diagnosed and unmedicated, SWEDD and healthy control subjects),I will:
* **Classify clinical diagnosis for each patient**
* **Predict Parkinson Disease Progression over time** using:  
   * 2a. First, only biological biomarkers . 
   * 2b. Add in a second time MRI data (raw brain scans from the PPMI dataset) . 
 (the idea is to compare the performance of the models with and without MRI data, as performing MRI is expensive for hospitals and also not easy to process as data).
* **Predict best treatment strategy associated to each patient and each future disease state**
* If enough time: **_predicting patients' time of death_** (see recent article about Google having done such predictions)
* If enough time: **_ANALYZE TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF BIOMARKERS USING LONGITUDINAL STABILITY SELECTION_**
(as done on AD in Fused Sparse Group Lasso Paper)

_NB: SWEDD= Scans without evidence of dopamine deficit: patients who look like they have PD in terms of symptom but subsequent functional imaging assessment does not confirm this._

### 2. **MAIN DATASET**: 
http://www.ppmi-info.org/access-data-specimens/download-data/
#### Data Pop : 2144 patients (as of SCREEN tables). 1052 PD people (PD (Gen and non Gen cohort), SWEDD, PRODROMA)
#### Patients Hospital visits timeline (timeseries period): 
* 15 visits besides screening, Baseline and unscheduled visits. 
* -> V04b: every 3 month / V05b -> V13: every 6 months / V14, V15 and beyond; every 12 months.

### 3. DS main challenges for this project: 
* Multi-modal (dataframes + MRI scans) multi-label classification problem of timeseries with features selection depending on the label prediction (the PD predominant biomarkers are depending on the disease state)


### 4. Use cases: 
* **FOR DOCTORS**: 
   * Early detection of PD subjects
   * Improving disease accuracy, 
   * Anticipation of their patients' disease evolution
   * support to decision for choosing treatments for patients
* **FOR PD PATIENTS**: 
  * For people with risk of getting PD: early detection and monitoring 
  * For early-stage/late-stage PD people: monitoring better their disease by knowing the expected evolution
  * Finding the best treatment that will improve the quality of life of PD people
* **FOR HOSPITALS**: 
 * cost reductions by improved patient management & treatment optimization
 * operations improvement by predicting patients future visits, med supplies, etc...

### 5.DS Process for the project 
1. **Data Processing/Cleaning**: Merge/Join of Tables (eventually using PyTables)

2. **EDA**: timeseries analysis & plotting
> look @ sparsity, irregularity,trends... 

3.**Feature Engineering:** (if classic ML is used)
  * Manual Feature Engineering with the help of doctors 
  * Statistical techniques to find correlation between features
  * Classic Feature Engineering Techniques for ML -> use manifold learning:
   * PCA: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html
   * t-SNE: https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/
   https://bl.ocks.org/Fil/b07d09162377827f1b3e266c43de6d2a

 https://github.com/cc-skuehn/Manifold_Learning . 
 https://towardsdatascience.com/reducing-dimensionality-from-dimensionality-reduction-techniques-f658aec24dfe
   * autoencoders
  
4. **ML/DL models to try:** 
 * **Baseline**: a statistical model > the one for a multivariate timeseries with endogeneous variables without trends and without seasonality = VARMA. 
     * other possibilities: discounted median, persistence model. 
 > Some references: https://machinelearningmastery.com/persistence-time-series-forecasting-with-python/
 
 * **"Explainable" models**: gradient-boosted trees, Random Forest

 * DL Models to be modified to include incertainty with bayesian models
    * Hidden Markov Models

  #### NB: maybe the problem of allocating treatments to disease states over time could be solved by reinforcement learning as well
